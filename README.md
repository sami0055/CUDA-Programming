Title: Introduction to CUDA Programming

Description:
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It enables developers to harness the immense computational power of NVIDIA GPUs for a wide range of tasks, from scientific simulations to machine learning and data processing.

With CUDA, programmers can write code in C/C++ and offload computationally intensive tasks to the GPU, taking advantage of its massively parallel architecture. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to CUDA programming, offering tutorials, code examples, and best practices for optimizing performance.
